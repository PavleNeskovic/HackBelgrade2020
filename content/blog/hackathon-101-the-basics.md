The first hackathon I attended I was scared of how will my team perform, will we succeed and what will happen if we had a topic that requires programming language that no-one in the team knows.
But no one told me that the hackathon is not about knowing what and how to do something, but about learning it - fast!

For me, at least point of hackathons become to learn new programming languages, new ways of presenting your ideas and most importantly new people.

## Hackathons are for learning and meeting new people.

- There is a saying &quot;Knowledge gained from books cannot be compared with that gained from experience.&quot; and hackathons prove it completely right. You will gain more practical knowledge in one hackathon than you will in a month of a lecture. You will learn how to work with other members of your team, how to manage a project, how to brainstorm and generate ideas. You can also learn how to use APIs, debug and how to deploy your project. All those skills will make you a better developer.

- You will be one of more than 200 people at the HackBelgrade 2020 event so you won&#39;t be alone and you are surely going to make some new friends. You&#39;ll get to meet people from all around the world. People who are into tech or DIY projects, people who love to push themselves forward. It is a fantastic place to learn from others and build connections for the future.

## Hackathons are not expensive to attend

- If you think that you cannot afford one - Think again! HackBelgrade is completely free to attend and we will provide you free food, drinks, and snacks during the whole event. We will even help you find super cheap accommodation for you (if we don&#39;t provide you with one). Some hackathons even organize transport of travel reimbursements, unfortunately, we are still not on that stage for now but we will notify you if something changes in the meantime!

## Is this your first hackathon? Don&#39;t be scared!

- Hackathons are super fun if you relax a bit and enjoy the atmosphere. Even if you come alone and you don&#39;t know anybody, there are friendly people all around you so you will meet new friends and we will have a team-matching session for people who don&#39;t come with the team.
- If you don&#39;t know where to start and how to find an idea, just know this - That is completely normal for newcomers. Most people don&#39;t have an idea of how this event even looks like and what they should do until they attend it for the first time.
- Are you in doubt about something or you can&#39;t figure something out? I suggest you to ask people around you or one of the mentors or hackathon organizers. We are all here to have a good time and to help each other.

## Don&#39;t just work, have a good rest, eat healthy food and above all - Have a great time!

- Even if you want to win and to finish your project, remember to have a good rest. If you want to finish on time and have a good presentation, you and your team need to be at your best game and that means good rest and healthy food. One of the good ways for the whole team to be rested is to sleep in shifts, one part of the team is coding and preparing for the demo while others are resting from work sprint.
